Changelog - 2026-02-02 (v0.70)
===============================

Branch: main

Summary:
--------
Fixed F7A Hornet Mk II missing weapons (nose turret and ball turret).

Changes:
--------
1. Fixed Anvil F7A Hornet Mk II ship spec:
   - Added 2x S3 nose turret guns to pilotWeapons (now 4 total: 2x S4 wing + 2x S3 nose)
   - Added ball turret as a remote turret with 2x S3 guns
   - Ball turret (C5-173f) is pilot-controlled but swappable to TMSB-5

2. Fixed Hornet F7A Mk II PYAM Exec ship spec:
   - Same hardpoint changes as base variant

3. Fixed Hornet F7A Mk II PYAM Exec stock loadout:
   - Added missing pilot weapons (Revenant Gatling x2, NDB-30 Repeater x2)
   - Added missing turret weapons (NDB-30 Repeater x2)

4. Updated extract-ships.js to handle pilot-controlled turrets:
   - extractPilotWeapons() now handles Turret.CanardTurret (nose turrets)
     by counting their weapons as pilot weapons
   - extractTurrets() now handles Turret.BallTurret as a "remote" turret
   - This ensures future ships with similar setups are correctly extracted

Technical Notes:
----------------
- CanardTurret (nose turret): Fixed pilot-controlled turret, guns count as pilot weapons
- BallTurret: Pilot-controlled but swappable, tracked as "remote" turret
- The sync script only adds new ships, so manual fixes won't be overwritten

Files Modified:
---------------
- app.js - Version 0.67 -> 0.70
- index.html - Cache-busting v=67 -> v=70
- data.js - Fixed F7A Hornet Mk II and PYAM Exec ship specs and loadouts
- scripts/extract-ships.js - Handle CanardTurret and BallTurret types
